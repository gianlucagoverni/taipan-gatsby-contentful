We know only that the project had been born in Taiwan where the hull had been built. It sailed then over the ocean towards the South-American seas where all wooden parts were added. It still remains a mystery how it arrived in Europe... I remember that during travels in childhood my grandfather was telling me how he had bought the yacht â€“ fantastic stories about pirates which in my eyes and in darkness of a lonely creek could have become reality... Thus, from bay to bay, from harbour to harbour, our travel with Tai Pan continued over the Mediterranean. I have travelled a lot with this yacht and from the beginning it seemed to me slow, clumsy and annoying... As time passed, I have learned though to appreciate and admire it, and to understand that sailing on a powerboat is not necessarily fast.</p>
